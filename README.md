# QuizIT

QuitIT is an Android app with the main goal of providing helpful information to certain IT topics in a quiz-like manner.
It was developed as a part of my bachelor thesis where I compared cross-platform and native Android app development.

The native app can be found [here](https://github.com/studAlexP/QuizIT_Flutter).

## Getting Started
These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

+ [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (tested with Android Studio Flamingo | 2022.2.1 Patch 1)

### Installing
From your command line:
```
